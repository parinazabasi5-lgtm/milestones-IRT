R scripts and minimal docs for item response modeling of developmental milestone items (Germany–Namibia project).
# Milestones-IRT

Minimal, beginner-friendly repository to demonstrate how I plan to analyze **developmental milestone** items using **Item Response Theory (IRT)** in **R** for the Leuphana/MPI project (Germany–Namibia).

**What’s here (to be added next steps):**
- `R/irt_demo.R`: simulate items and fit 2PL model with `mirt`
- `R/cleaning_pipeline.R`: simple questionnaire cleaning (recoding, missing data)
- `R/efa_cfa.R`: quick EFA/CFA example for scale structure
- `docs/README`: short workflow notes, figures (ICC, test information)

I will keep the code very simple, well-commented, and reproducible so committee members can quickly see my workflow even if they don’t run the code.

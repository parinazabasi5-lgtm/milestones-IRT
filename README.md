# Milestones IRT

A small repository outlining how I plan to analyze developmental milestone items with Item Response Theory (IRT) in R for the Leuphana/MPI project.

## What's inside
- `R/irt_demo.R` — minimal 2PL example with simulated data (item parameters + optional plots)
- `R/cleaning_pipeline.R` — to be added: simple template for cleaning parent-item data
- `R/efa_cfa.R` — to be added: quick EFA/CFA sketch for scale structure
- `docs/` — to be added: short workflow notes and figures

## How to run 
1. In RStudio, install the package **mirt** (Packages → Install).
2. Open `R/irt_demo.R` and click **Run** to print item parameters.  
   Optional: uncomment the two `plot(...)` lines to see an item characteristic curve and the test information curve.
